# Traffic Signs Detection

## Problem Statement
In urban environments, efficient routing/transport of goods is a huge problem. To solve that problem we are creating a computer vision-based that can solution that can analyze images of roadways to detect and classify stationary objects.

## Dataset
Two types of dataset
1. Only sign dataset (Easily available)
2. Signs with background (Actual on images with curation)
    1. Vietnam traffic signs (duplicate data)
    2. Moroccan traffic signs ( less data, Arabic )
